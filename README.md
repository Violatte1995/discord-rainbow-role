**How to start using it?**

- To get started, download the project to yourself. **[ git clone https://github.com/perssBest/discord-rainbow-role ]**
- After we create the **.env** file(if you upload the code to the hosting).
In this file we write the following:
```javascript
token=YOUR BOT TOKEN
```
[I want to warn you right away that this is a violation of the rules of discord, for these actions you can get a ban on IP and a block of the developer panel. Please read the official rules by clicking on me: D](https://discordapp.com/terms)

- If you decide to continue further, then go to the next step.

- We need to install the discord.js module **[ npm i discord.js ]**

- Next, go to the сonfig.json and configure everything for yourself!

> It should be understood that the code will not work on some hosting sites. I recommend using the vds server for this.

- Also, do not set the time less than 1000 in the config.json. This is dangerous! To avoid a ban, it is recommended to set the time for one minute.
